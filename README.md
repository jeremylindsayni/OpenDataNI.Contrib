# OpenDataNI.Contrib

A proof of concept - a place where NI data could be submitted that for some reason isn't on the OpenData NI portal yet.

This data could be 
* crowdsourced 
* a format that's easily readable by a person but not by a machine (e.g. PDF), with an invite for someone from the community to convert to machine readable format
* incomplete

Issues can be submitted with the dataset describing problems or work that needs to be done before the data could be promoted to the OpenData NI portal.
